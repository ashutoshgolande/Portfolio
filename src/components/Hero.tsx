            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm Ashutosh Ravindra Golande, a passionate Software Development Engineer 
              currently working at Cars24. I graduated from IIT Kharagpur with a B.Tech in 
              Computer Science & Engineering, achieving a CGPA of 7.63/10.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey in technology has been driven by a deep interest in backend development, 
              database management, and creating scalable software solutions. I enjoy solving complex 
              problems and building systems that make a real impact. With a strong foundation in 
              algorithms and data structures, I'm always eager to take on new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, I'm probably exploring new technologies, participating in NSO activities, 
              or working on personal projects. I believe in continuous learning and am always looking 
              for opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.
